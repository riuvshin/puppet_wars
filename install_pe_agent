Installing the Agent Node

On the agent node, log in as root or with a root shell. (Use sudo -s to get a root shell if your operating system’s root account is disabled.)
Download the Puppet Enterprise tarball [http://info.puppetlabs.com/download-pe.html], extract it, and navigate to the directory it creates.
Run ./puppet-enterprise-installer. The installer will ask a series of questions about which components to install, and how to configure them.
Skip the puppet master role.
Provide the puppet master hostname; in this case, master.example.com. If you configured the master to be reachable at puppet, you can alternately accept the default.
Skip the database support and console roles.
Install the puppet agent role. The cloud provisioner role is optional and is not used in this exercise.
Make sure that the unique “certname” matches the hostname you chose for this node. (For example, agent1.example.com.)
Accept the default responses for every other question by hitting enter.
The installer will then install and configure Puppet Enterprise.
